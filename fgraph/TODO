* clarify the semantics of fgraph_edge_count and fgraph_edge_count_all
  on an undirected graph. clarify the semantics of fgraph_edge_count in
  general, i.e. should it be called fgraph_edge_count when it only returns
  outgoing edges? 

* reorganize the way vectors work: they should merely be a shell around
  an array and a variable containing the size of the array. no automatic
  resizing or anything like that. what follows then:
  + fgraph_vec_resize(fgraph_vec_t **vec, unsigned long size);

* remove 'fgraph_list_t' and make it into 'fgraph_queue_t' and use it like
  a lifo queue. what follows then:
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_init(fgraph_list_t **list);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_clear(fgraph_list_t **list);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_add(fgraph_list_t **list, long value);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_remove(fgraph_list_t **list, unsigned long idx, long *rvalue);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_get(fgraph_list_t **list, unsigned long idx, long *rvalue);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_set(fgraph_list_t **list, unsigned long idx, long value);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_size(fgraph_list_t **list, unsigned long *rvalue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_queue_init(fgraph_queue_t **queue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_queue_clear(fgraph_queue_t **queue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_queue_add(fgraph_queue_t **queue, long value);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_queue_remove(fgraph_queue_t **queue, long *rvalue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_queue_size(fgraph_queue_t **queue, unsigned long *rvalue);

* change fgraph_heap_t into fgraph_minpq_t because it really is a priority queue and not
  a heap. maybe implement a heap as well, but not critical. what follows:
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_init(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long max);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_clear(fgraph_heap_t **heap);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_insert(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long key, fgraph_edge_weight_t value);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_remove(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long *rkey);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_decrease(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long key, fgraph_edge_weight_t value);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_size(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long *rsize);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_max(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long *rmax);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_swim(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long i);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_sink(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long i);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_more(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long i, unsigned long j, int *rbool);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_swap(fgraph_heap_t **heap, unsigned long i, unsigned long j);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_init(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long max);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_clear(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_insert(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long key, fgraph_edge_weight_t value);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_remove(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long *rkey);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_decrease(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long key, fgraph_edge_weight_t value);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_size(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long *rsize);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_max(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long *rmax);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_swim(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long i);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_sink(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long i);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_more(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long i, unsigned long j, int *rbool);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_minpq_swap(fgraph_minpq_t **minpq, unsigned long i, unsigned long j);

* add functions to remove duplicate edges in a graph. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_edge_remove_duplicates(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long from, unsigned long to); /* maybe simplify instead? */
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_edge_remove_duplicates_all(fgraph_t **graph); /* maybe simplify instead? */
  
* get rid of fgraph_vec_length. it is inconsistent with the rest of the
  datastructure interface. what follows:
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_vec_length(fgraph_vec_t **vec, unsigned long *rvalue);
  
* add copy constructors for basically everything. should they be called copy
  or clone? what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_copy(fgraph_t **graph, fgraph_t **ograph);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_vec_copy(fgraph_vec_t **vec, fgraph_vec_t **ovec);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_stack_copy(fgraph_stack_t **stack, fgraph_stack_t **ostack);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_list_copy(fgraph_list_t **list, fgraph_list_t **olist); /* may be queue in the future */
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_heap_copy(fgraph_heap_t **heap, fgraph_heap_t **oheap); /* may be minpq in the future */
  
* add visiting support, such that you traverse a graph and have a callback
  function for each vertex visited. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_traverse_bfs(fgraph_t **graph, void (*func)(unsigned long)); /* is void the right return type? */
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_traverse_dfs(fgraph_t **graph, void (*func)(unsigned long)); /* is void the right return type? */
  
* add transitive closure support. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_closure_transitive(fgraph_t **graph);

* add support for checking whether two nodes are connected or not. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_connected_is(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long from, unsigned long to, int *rbool); /* bad name? */

* add support for getting the size of a graph. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_size(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long *rvalue);
  
* add support for getting all the neighbors of a vertex. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_size(fgraph_t **graph, fgraph_vec_t **rvec);
  
* rename fgraph_edge_count and fgraph_edge_count_all to fgraph_vertex_degree. what follows:
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_edge_count_all(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long *rvalue);
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_edge_count(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long vtx, unsigned long *rvalue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_vertex_degree_all(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long *rvalue);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_vertex_degree(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long vtx, unsigned long *rvalue);
  
* add support for making an unweighted graph weighted, or a directed graph undirected. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_convert_weighted(fgraph_t **graph);
  + fgraph_return_t fgrpah_convert_unweighted(fgraph_t **graph);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_convert_undirected(fgraph_t **graph);

* should sp_bfs take another paramter, *rlength, for the resulting path length?
  - fgraph_return_t fgraph_sp_bfs(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long from, unsigned long to, fgraph_vec_t **rvec);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_sp_bfs(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long from, unsigned long to, fgraph_vec_t **rvec, fgraph_edge_weight_t *rlength);

* fix all the FGRAPH_ENULL returns and actually check for nulls. /facepalm

* add support for graph coloring operations. what follows:
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_color_is_kcolorable_bf(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long ncolors, int *rbool);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_color_is_kcolorable(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long ncolors, int *rbool);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_color_kcoloring_bf(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long ncolors, fgraph_vec_t **rvec);
  + fgraph_return_t fgraph_color_kcoloring(fgraph_t **graph, unsigned long ncolors, fgraph_vec_t **rvec);
